##### How to Install the App #####
Welcome to OneMoreRep's README. I will explain how to install and successfully use/operate 
the application. Go to the github url:
 (https://github.com/gcampbell391/ruby-project-alt-guidelines-atlanta-web-021720) and clone the file.
 In your terminal type "git clone" followed by the SSH key on github in the desired directory. This 
 will create the project folder for the application. The project folder can now be opened. Once 
 the folder is open, open the terminal next. Type "ruby bin/run.rb" in the terminal to start the 
 application. If you have any issues you may have to run "bundle install" or "rake db:seed" in the terminal for all the gems to be installed and implement the seed data.

##### How to Run the App #####
 Once the application loads up, you have the option to log in as an existing user or create a new 
 account if you're new to the app. If you would like to create an account, select "Create_New_Account".
 Proceed through all the information prompts to complete account setup. After completion you will be brought back to the menu with your new credentials ready to sign in. Now select log-in if you haven't already. Enter your username and password to access account. Application is space and cap sensitive,
 so please be careful with what your enter. Most options include what should be entered. Once you gain 
 access to your account, you have a few options.You can update your personal information, add/log a workout, view past all workouts, delete your account, and lastly log out. 
 ##### Menu Options #####
